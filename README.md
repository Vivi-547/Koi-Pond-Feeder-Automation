# Koi-Pond-Feeder-Automation
This Arduino-based automation controls a koi pond feeder and water pump. It activates the water pump when the water level reaches a certain height using a two-wire sensor and dispenses food every 6 hours via a feeder motor. The system uses relays to manage both the pump and feeder, ensuring efficient pond maintenance with real-time feedback via the Serial Monitor.
